# Rails & React Pilot Social App

This project was created with Rails and React. 
For the App I decided to combine Rails and React into a single application. 
One of the main reasons I chose to do this was to use a single dyno on Heroku.
Reflecting after I would not combine both for an app much larger than the one created here.

That being said:
I used Rails mainly for the backend as a regular API.
All the pages utilize React for the front end.
And I was able to use Rails for the navbar as well as Devise for authentication with the Devise views in Rails.
